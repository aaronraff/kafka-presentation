The examples in this repository are based on the demo applications under the Apache Kafka Streams Quickstart
section on their website: https://kafka.apache.org/22/documentation/streams/tutorial.

I also referenced the examples in this Github repository maintained by 
Confluent: https://github.com/confluentinc/kafka-streams-examples.
